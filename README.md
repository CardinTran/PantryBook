**Task Management & Workflow**

We are using a Kanban board to manage all project tasks: https://github.com/users/CardinTran/projects/4

**How task selection works**

* Team members may self-select tasks from the Kanban board.
* Priorities are indicated using the Priority field (P0–P4).
* P0 tasks should be addressed first, as they are foundational or blocking.
  
**Accountability & Rebalancing**

* During the first week, task ownership is flexible to allow everyone to ramp up.
* After the initial week of execution, task assignments may be rebalanced based on:
  * Task throughput
  * Responsiveness
  * Quality and timeliness of deliverables
* This is to ensure critical work progresses smoothly and the team remains unblocked.

**Expectations**

* Only take tasks you can actively work on.
* Move tasks across columns as status changes.
* Communicate blockers early.
* Keep scope tight and aligned with the Kanban priorities.
